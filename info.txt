How it will work:
 1) Get dataset from github(we can choose any dataset)
 2) Train the AI on dataset (we may need multiple large one's)
 3) We will use stable defussion and/or pychart to train the AI

No front end or client side required but I can build one anyways

Goal of the AI: 
 - AI will use  dataset (example skin condition) and then create similar photos
 - Goal is that instead of using real people to show diseases company's / medical providers will be able to use the AI

Idea for frontend: 
- Maybe have a input field where you say what AI image you want
- Maybe use buttons / form to collect information on what they want

Usecase 1) can you generate the image of lungs of a smoker and a normal lung
Usecase 2) here is a photo of a diseases, can you tell me what it is?

Right now we could focus on lung cancer (images of lungs), but later we could expend to other diseases
